# vanilllaJsTodo

It's fairly simple Todo app built in purely javascript. OOP and Tdd practices have been used to create this app. 

Aim was to practice and explore some design patterns. 

Would love all code reviews and critiques. 

Main code is in public/javascripts/script.js

All items are persistent and use localStorage api.
